Some tweaking of the system, to have more control and better workflow of the GNOME desktop environment.

One annoying thing is the audio step, that by default is set to 5. For more or less control and accuracy of the audio volume, change it with the desire value, in this case.
- Volume step = `2`

``` bash
gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.media-keys volume-step 2
```

Next is it possible to bind some shortcut to improve the workflow of the system.

- Launch applications:

| Command              | Shortcut    |
| -------------------- | ----------- |
| Terminal             | `super + T` |
| Browser              | `super + F` |
| File manager         | `super + E` |
| System settings      | `super + I` |
| Note taking          | `super + N` |
| Application launcher | `super + A` |

- Motion and control

| Command                     | Shortcut              |
| --------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Kill application            | `super + Q`           |
| Go to last workspace        | `super + 0`           |
| Move to the right workspace | `super + TAB`         |
| Move to the left workspace  | `super + shift + TAB` |

> For the next binding - workspace, keep in mind to disable **dynamic workspaces** in the **gnome-control-settings** to a better usability of each shortcut and more organization of each workspace.

- Switch to a desire workspace:

| Command     | Shortcut    |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Workspace 1 | `super + 1` |
| Workspace 2 | `super + 2` |
| Workspace 3 | `super + 3` |
| Workspace 4 | `super + 4` |
| Workspace 5 | `super + 5` |
| Workspace 6 | `super + 6` |
| Workspace 7 | `super + 7` |
| Workspace 8 | `super + 8` |
| Workspace 9 | `super + 9` |
> It is recommend to use the command binding provided by **dconf** because the *gnome-control-center* is limited to 4 workspace.

`dconf write /org/gnome/desktop/wm/keybindings/switch-to-workspace-1 "['<Super>1']"`

And edit the value `1` based on the X workspace binding.

- Move application to a desire workspace:

| Command                         | Shortcut            |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Move application to workspace 1 | `super + shift + 1` |
| Move application to workspace 2 | `super + shift + 2` |
| Move application to workspace 3 | `super + shift + 3` |
| Move application to workspace 4 | `super + shift + 4` |
| Move application to workspace 5 | `super + shift + 5` |
| Move application to workspace 6 | `super + shift + 6` |
| Move application to workspace 7 | `super + shift + 7` |
| Move application to workspace 8 | `super + shift + 8` |
| Move application to workspace 9 | `super + shift + 9` |
> It is recommend to use the command binding provided by **dconf** because the *gnome-control-center* is limited to 4 workspace.

`dconf write /org/gnome/desktop/wm/keybindings/move-to-workspace-1 "['<Shift><Super>1']"` 

And edit the value `1` based on the X workspace binding. 
## Ricing of the desktop environment
To rice a bit the system, install some packages for GNOME shell theme, icon theme, cursor and extensions. This is all about preferences so fell free to ignore the recommendations and all the packages installed in the following sections to make your own system.

Icons:
- [MoreWaita](https://github.com/somepaulo/MoreWaita)
- [adw-gkt3](https://github.com/lassekongo83/adw-gtk3)
- [papirus-icon-theme](https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-icon-theme)
	- extend with [papirus-folder-git](https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-folders)
- [flat-remix](https://github.com/daniruiz/flat-remix)

Cursor:
- [bibata-cursor](https://github.com/ful1e5/Bibata_Cursor)

Application:
- [Firefox](https://github.com/rafaelmardojai/firefox-gnome-theme)
- [Thunderbird](https://github.com/rafaelmardojai/thunderbird-gnome-theme)

For more custom experience in the GNOME desktop environment it is possible to install some extensions. There are listed some of my favorite one:
- [pop-shell!](https://github.com/pop-os/shell.git)
- [unite](https://github.com/hardpixel/unite-shell/)
- [Top bar organizer](https://github.com/jamespo/gnome-extensions/releases/download/gnome46/top-bar-organizerjulian.gse.jsts.xyz.v10.shell-extension.zip)

This are some of my extensions that I install in my system, for more details, please check the dotfiles and the `ext_installer` and the list of all extensions passed to the installer.
## Additional notes
- Fix **Arch Linux update indicator**

`blackbox -- /bin/sh -c "echo 'Starting update...' && sudo pacman -Syu && echo 'Done - Press enter to exit' && read _"`
