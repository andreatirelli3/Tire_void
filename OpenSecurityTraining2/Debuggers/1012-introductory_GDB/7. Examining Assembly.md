## One-time Disassembly Display

The **_`disassemble`_** command (_short form: **disas**_) _by itself_ will show you assembly surrounding the current location you are stopped at.

The **_`disassemble <address or symbol name>`_** command will disassemble the memory specified by the address or symbol name.

You can optionally give the **_/r_** argument after _disassemble_ to display the **_r_**_aw bytes_ which make up the instructions.

You can optionally give the **_/m_** argument after _disassemble_ to **_m_**_ix source code and assembly_.

To give both arguments simultaneously, they must be combined as "/rm".

Alternatively, one form of the **_x_** (e**x**amine memory) command (which we'll learn more about later), can display some number of instructions (10 in the below example) at a given address. That form is:

**_`x/10i <address>`_**
## Continuously-updating Disassembly Display

One form of the **_display_** command (which we'll learn more about later), can ensure that every time the program stops, that some number of instructions (10 in the below example) are printed out starting at the address given in a register that represents the next assembly instruction for the CPU to execute. That form is:

**_`display/10i <instruction pointer / program counter>`_**

On x86 systems the register is named the "instruction pointer", and specifically "RIP" for 64-bit code, so the command would be _`display/10i $rip`_

On x86 systems the register is named the "instruction pointer", and specifically "EIP" for 32-bit code, so the command would be _`display/10i $eip`_

On ARM or RISC-V systems the registers is named the "program counter" would be _`display/10i $pc`_
