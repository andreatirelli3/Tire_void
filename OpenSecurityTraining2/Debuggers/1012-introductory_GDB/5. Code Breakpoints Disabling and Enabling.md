## Disabling Breakpoints:

After getting a breakpoint number from "info b", a breakpoint can be disabled with

**_`disable <breakpoint number>`_**

A subsequent run of "info b" will show the breakpoint as "n" in the "Enb" (enabled) column of output. E.g.:

```
(gdb) info b
Num     Type           Disp Enb Address            What
1       breakpoint     keep y   0x00005555555551a9 <main>
    breakpoint already hit 1 time
(gdb) disable 1
(gdb) info b
Num     Type           Disp Enb Address            What
1       breakpoint     keep n   0x00005555555551a9 <main>
    breakpoint already hit 1 time
```
