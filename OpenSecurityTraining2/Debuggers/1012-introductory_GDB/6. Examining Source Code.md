## Listing source code lines

This option is only relevant to situations in which you have the source code for the program being debugged, and it was built with symbols enabled (the -g or -ggdb flags to gcc). It will not be useful when reverse engineering opaque binaries, but it is useful in some OST2 classes such as [Architecture 4021: Introductory UEFI](https://ost2.fyi/Arch4021), where you compile source code yourself.

The **_`list`_** command will show you source code surrounding the current location you are stopped at.

The **_`list <function name>`_** command will show source code before and after the given function.

The **_`list <source file name>:<line number>`_** command will show source code before and after the given line in the given file.
