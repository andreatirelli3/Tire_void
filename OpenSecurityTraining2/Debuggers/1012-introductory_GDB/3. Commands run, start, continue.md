## Running (or re-running) a program

The **_run_** (_short form: **r**_) command will run the program just the same as if you had invoked int from the CLI:

```
user@ubuntu:~$ gdb ./fibber_bin -q
Reading symbols from ./fibber_bin...
(gdb) r
Starting program: /home/user/fibber_bin 
First 10 elements of the Fibbonacci sequence: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 [Inferior 1 (process 60848) exited normally]
(gdb)
```

## Running a program that requires CLI arguments

If your program requires CLI arguments, they can be passed after the run command, the same way they would be if you were directly invoking the program. So for instance for this code:

```
#include <stdio.h>
void main(int argc, char ** argv){
    if(argv[1] != NULL && argv[1] != ""){
        printf("You entered %s for argv[1]\n", argv[1]);
    } else {
        printf("You didn't enter an argv[1]\n");
    }
}
```

The result is:

```
user@ubuntu:~$ gdb ./echo_bin -q
Reading symbols from ./echo_bin...
(gdb) r
Starting program: /home/user/echo_bin 
You didn't enter an argv[1]
[Inferior 1 (process 60868) exited with code 034]
(gdb) r hi
Starting program: /home/user/echo_bin hi
You entered hi for argv[1]
[Inferior 1 (process 60872) exited with code 033]
(gdb) r yo
Starting program: /home/user/echo_bin yo
You entered yo for argv[1]
[Inferior 1 (process 60873) exited with code 033]
```
## Starting a program and breaking at its entry point

The **_start_** command is like _run_, except it sets a breakpoint on the entry point of the program. (A later class on binaries will teach you how to find the entry point yourself.)

```
user@ubuntu:~$ gdb ./fibber_bin -q
Reading symbols from ./fibber_bin...
(gdb) start 
Temporary breakpoint 1 at 0x1189
Starting program: /home/user/fibber_bin 

Temporary breakpoint 1, 0x0000555555555189 in main ()
(gdb)
```

Like _run_, you can specify additional CLI arguments after the _start_ command:

```
user@ubuntu:~$ gdb ./echo_bin -q
Reading symbols from ./echo_bin...
(No debugging symbols found in ./echo_bin)
(gdb) start hi
Temporary breakpoint 1 at 0x1169
Starting program: /home/user/echo_bin hi

Temporary breakpoint 1, 0x0000555555555169 in main ()
(gdb)
```
## Continuing execution of a program stopped at a breakpoint

If you started the program with _start_, you can continue its execution from the temporary breakpoint it sets by using **_continue_** (_short form: **c**_).

```
user@ubuntu:~$ gdb ./echo_bin -q
Reading symbols from ./echo_bin...
(gdb) start hi
Temporary breakpoint 1 at 0x1169
Starting program: /home/user/echo_bin hi

Temporary breakpoint 1, 0x0000555555555169 in main ()
(gdb) c
Continuing.
You entered hi for argv[1]
[Inferior 1 (process 60985) exited with code 033]
(gdb)
```
